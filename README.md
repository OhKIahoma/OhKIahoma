##### ABOUT ME üç´
  * I go by Seth, & sometimes Trish, Cio, or Ris
* 19 years old, Bisexual & Genderfluid
  * He/Him & She/Her only. Don't refer to me with feminine terms unless told otherwise.
* DNI if you kin Trish Una, Risotto Nero, Caesar Zeppeli, Aki Hayakawa or Cioccolata
   * See carrd for extra stuff + more kins.

##### Before You Interact üíâ 
* I'm often off-tab/afk, whisper me instead.
* Sitting with a friend as two characters doesn't always mean we are shipping them
* You may sit and/or chat with me whenever you want, I'm not mean and won't complain and/or be rude about it like others do.
    * That being said, I am not comfortable with anybody below sixteen (16) being my friend. Please respect this.
* I don't have a long DNI list that you wouldn't read even if I did, but please DNI if you're heavily into drama, 
  
    or if you're faking any mental disorders currently. (DID, Psychosis). I use the term IRL on my Kins for fun, not because I fake disorders.
    * I don't believe in, nor do I support TT/TD, I won't go out of my way to touch you but I won't speak to you if you try to talk to me.
