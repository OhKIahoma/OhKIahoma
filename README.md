##### Before You Interact üíâ 
  * I'm often off-tab/afk, whisper me instead.
* Sitting with a friend as two characters doesn't always mean we are shipping them
* You may sit and/or chat with me whenever you want, I'm not mean and won't complain and/or be rude about it like others do.
  * That being said, I am not comfortable with anybody below sixteen (16) being my friend. Please respect this.
* I don't have a long DNI list that you wouldn't read even if I did, but please DNI if you're heavily into drama, or if you're faking any mental disorders currently. (DID, Psychosis). 
    * I don't believe in, nor do I support TT/TD, I won't go out of my way to touch you but I won't speak to you if you try to talk to me.
